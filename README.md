# Hello, Note!
*Hello, Note!* is a simple and easy to use Google Chrome Extension for taking notes as you browse. It can be used by clicking the extension icon in the toolbar and typing into the text field.
The user is also able to save their notes as a plain text file to their computer.

## Functionality
This extension utilizes the local storage on your browser to restore entered text even when mouse focus on the extension is lost. The data remains on local storage and is not visible to the developer (me).


## Future Updates
- Preserve `\n`ewlines after text restoraion
- Beautify the UI of the notepad and let the user change the color theme
- Allow different file formats for saving text
- Allow user upload of text files


Hello, Note! will be available to Google Chrome store pending review.
